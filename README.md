# Vet clinic database: query and update animals table

> In this project, I used a relational database to create the initial data structure for a vet clinic. I created a table to store animals' information, insert some data into it, and query it.

<div align='center'><img src="./images/Table animals.png" alt="table"></div>

> Here, I used transactions to update and delete records, aggregate functions and "GROUP By" to answer analytical questions.

## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database.
